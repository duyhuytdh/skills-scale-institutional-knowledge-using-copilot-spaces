OctoAcme Project Management Overview

OctoAcme organizes work around lightweight, repeatable artifacts and a steady delivery rhythm to keep teams aligned and reduce risk. Every initiative starts with a Project One‑pager that states the problem, measurable success metrics, stakeholders, and a high‑level timeline. Approved initiatives move through a Planning phase that creates a prioritized backlog, sprint plans, and a Definition of Done. Teams operate a project board (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done) and follow a scoped PR workflow encouraging small, focused changes that include issue links, acceptance criteria, and passing CI before review and merge.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit to ensure clear ownership and accountability. Product Managers (PdMs) define outcomes and prioritize the backlog; Project Managers (PMs) coordinate schedules, risks, and stakeholder communications; Developers implement and test features and participate in reviews; QA validates acceptance criteria through a mix of automated and manual testing. Key artifacts include the Project One‑pager, roadmap/release plan, sprint backlog, acceptance criteria/DoD, risk register, and retrospective action items.

Communication is structured to surface progress and risks early. Teams run daily standups for progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs and PM–PdM alignments for decisions and risk review, sprint demos or milestone reviews for stakeholder feedback, and monthly updates for broader groups. The risk register is reviewed regularly and escalation follows a defined path (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor). The docs also provide templates for weekly status updates and incident communication to ensure consistent stakeholder messaging.

Quality and release practices emphasize test coverage, automated checks, and safe deployments. Developers add unit and integration tests for new logic, and critical flows have end‑to‑end smoke tests. CI runs tests, linting, and security scans before merges. Releases are classified as patch, minor, or major and are gated by acceptance criteria, passing CI/security checks, release notes, and a rollback plan; deployments use staging smoke tests and post‑deploy verifications. Retrospectives capture learnings and convert them to tracked backlog items for continuous improvement.
