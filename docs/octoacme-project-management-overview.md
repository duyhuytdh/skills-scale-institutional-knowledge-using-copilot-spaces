# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles
- Project Manager (PM): coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications.
- Product Manager (PdM): defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- Developers: implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- QA/Testing: validate quality and acceptance criteria.
- UI/UX Designer: creates user-centered designs and ensures usability.
- Site Reliability Engineer (SRE): ensures system reliability and operational excellence.
- Data Analyst: provides insights and metrics to inform decisions.
- Customer Success Manager: represents customer voice and ensures adoption.
- Compliance Lead: guides compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Stakeholders: provide inputs and approvals.

For detailed role descriptions and interaction patterns, see [OctoAcme Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).

## Key Artifacts
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

## Lifecycle (high-level)
1. Initiation: problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline.
2. Planning: scope, resources, milestones, dependencies.
3. Execution: build, test, review, iterate.
4. Release: deploy, verify, announce.
5. Close & Retrospective: capture learnings and next steps.

## Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed

## How to use these docs
- Keep the Project Charter updated in the project repo.
- Add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context.
- Refer to the [Cross-Role Collaboration Guide](octoacme-cross-role-collaboration-guide.md) for handoff patterns and communication best practices.
- Use the [Handoff Checklist Template](octoacme-handoff-checklist-template.md) to ensure smooth transitions between roles and phases.
